                <p>On the interwebs I am crashdotcom (crash !!). Nice to meet you. I'm in college now, but I've been creating things and writing down wild stories for as long as I can remember. I found my roots in writing really bad self-insert Percy Jackson fanfiction (unfortunately)! But I've since moved past that. I now have several developed stories and worlds of my own. Though they exist largely in my head, I love sharing them with other people and talking about my characters. That being said, this website exists largely for my own sake, so that I can keep track of everything and anything I've made. Feel free to peruse at your disposal.</p>
