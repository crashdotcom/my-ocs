        <h1>AKOI</h1>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>In the far distant future, AKOI rules all. A monopolizing superconglomerate company that got their humble beginnings in the agricultural shipping industry, their reach now extends over healthcare, transportation, the economy, pop culture, and more. It's impossible to walk two steps without seeing an AKOI branded product, seeing their logo plastered on the many digi-boards that line the cities, or even seeing an AKOIan android companion. Yes, throughout the decades, AKOI has pioneered many technological advances, including the commercialization of artificially intelligent robots that look and act like humans do--well, if you ignore the bare metal and wires that the lab-grown human skin can't fully hide.<br><br>Of course, AKOI couldn't do this alone. By employing--or shall we say, experimenting on--lab-grown humans and urchins snatched off the streets (who notices the disappearance of those already shunned by society?), AKOI was and is able to create new products and advancements at an unprecedented rate.</p>
